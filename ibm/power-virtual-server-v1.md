# IBM Power Cloud Virtual Server Course Notes

## Module 1: Power Virtual Server Overview

### Keywords
CapEx, OpEx, HADR, AIX, IBM i, MMA, IaaS, In-Core, Quantum Safe

### Key Elements
- CapEx to OpEx
- HA/DR (High Availability / Disaster Recover)
- AI in-core (MMA - Matrix Math Accelerator)
- Supported: AIX, IBM i, Linux (RHEL, SUSE)
  
### Operational Value (Oracle, SAP, IBM i)  
- Expand SAP clients to Power Virtual Server  
- Efficiently Scale Data-Intensive Workloads  
- Create a Backup/Restore Solution

### Supported Databases
- IBM DB2
- Oracle
- Postgre SQL
- MongoDB
- IBM Datastage
- IBM Cognos

### IaaS Options
- IBM Power: Business continuity and agility; end-to-end security
- Power Private Cloud with Dynamic Capacity: pay-as-you-go, cloud on premises with monitoring
- Power Virtual Server with IBM Cloud: VMaaS, consistent archtecture, cloud services, OpenShift

### Powe4 Virtual Server Use Cases
- Data Center Strategy Optimization
- Business Continuity Planning
- Modernize
- Improve Operational Cost

## Module 2: Power Virtual Server Architecture and Technology

### Keywords
RISC Processor, PowerVC, shared Storage Pool

### Key Elements
- Cores (8 cores, IBM i only 4 cores)
- RISC: Wide, high speed data pathways and multi-threading (vs x86)
- Power Virtualization Stack: PowerVC
- Virtualization without Limits: PowerVM, Power Hypervisor (PHYP), isolated VMs
- PowerVM: interface between VMs and physical hardware
- Virtual I/O Server (VIOS): many VMs, reduce costs, share storage pools
- PowerSC (Security and Compliance): role-based access, logs, automation, monitoring
- Matrix Math Accelerator (MMA): AI 'in-place', directly in the processor, accelerate inferencing

### Operating Systems
- Linux: RHEL, SUSE
- AIX: database systems, Oracle workloads
- IBM i: enhanced security - object based, business resiience, object-base addressing, virtualization, RTO Zero with DB2 Mirror
- SAP HANA: lower TCO - few cores to run workloads, consolidate servers, smaller footprint; RHEL and SLES

### Value Proposition of Shared Processor Pools (SPP)
- Oracle Licensing Optimization: reduce licenses by limiting uncapped partitions/processors; can add licenses as needed
- Reserve Capacity: capped price for later, saving OS licensing and memory costs

### Servers
- Scale Out: S922 and S1022 (4 cores limit on IBM i)
- Enterprise: E980 and E1080
